"<p>The results of this test were relatively accurate, it allows me to understand my view of the world against others. This in turn allows me to interact and see the social interactions I have viewed from a different person and adjust as required to accommodate the connection. The test will influence me in that I will need to accommodate others understanding, allowing other to come to their own conclusions rather than judging the conclusion early, that they make. This will allow me to work within a team more effectively. Understanding roles within a team is important, however working within a team in other role outside of my ‘comfort zone’ will allow better and deeper understanding of how the team can be better equipped for the future.</p>"+

"<p>John’s results, specifically the Miers-Briggs test placed John as an INFJ personality type, John contributions towards the team are indicated within the tests are being able to provide, insight and unorthodox thinking. This combined with the ability to form simple strategy from complexity provides the team with valuable angles of attack towards the tasks required. Johns' personality type is open-minded but has a sense of responsibility to the team. John is also conscientious and is agreeable towards other ideas and thoughts, understanding the inner dynamics of a team, this helps the teamwork together, yet John provides leadership where it's required with a steady and controlled empathy to others within the team. This is reflective across all three tests as can be seen within the graphics. </p>"+

From a young age I have always had a passion to create or improve. The first time I was exposed to Lego I was amazed, as it allowed me to create anything my imagination so desired. My hobbies include anything outdoors as well as computer games. The main interest in IT for me is the ability to create and improve. Within my own time Python allowed me to experiment and create little projects to better understand how the digital world works.

"<p>After reviewing the results its concluded that all three tests were relatively accurate towards my personality and work style. While the tests were true in some parts, it was inaccurate in other areas. The results of the Myers Brig test shows that I am an Advocate (INFJ-T). According to Myers-Briggs an advocate’s strengths are creative, insightful, principled, passionate, and altruistic. Through self-evaluation an advocate’s strengths do match my strengths. An advocate’s weaknesses are sensitive to criticism, reluctant to open up, perfectionistic, avoiding the ordinary, and prone to burnout. One aspect of the results I disagree with in the Myer-Briggs test is that advocates are perfectionistic. While I do believe its important to put in one hundred percent effort into my work, I do realize that we do not live in a perfect world and not everything can be perfect.</p>"+

"<h4>Truity</h4>" +
"<p>Reviewing the results from the Big Five Personality test I can agree that all five personality traits align with mine. It’s essential to know what my strengths and weaknesses are as it helps me understand my limitations on what I can and can’t do. By recognizing my weaknesses and strengths I will be aware of what I can contribute to the team and what parts I may struggle with. Knowing this it will directly influence my behavior towards my team as I would understand my limitations of what I can contribute to the team.</p>"+
"<div><img src='./TR_BigFive.PNG'></div>"+
"<p>The three tests helped me confirm and provide insight on my strengths and weaknesses which are important to know when working with a team. Teamwork is about a group of people working together in an efficient and effective manner to reach the same goal. It’s important to understand each member’s individual strengths and weaknesses to allocate the appropriate task.  The results I have obtained will help me convey my strengths and weaknesses to my team, helping not only myself but the team as well. This will help devise a plan/strategy to complete the assigned work effectively and efficiently.  </p>"+

"<h1><i class='fa-solid fa-chart-line fa-xl'></i> Industry Data</h1>" + 
"<p>Understanding job market demand is, for many people, a key factor in deciding what field they want to go into. According to ACS Australia’s Digital Pulse (2022), there has reportedly been an 8.0% growth in technology related employment in Australia. In comparison, there has been a 6.4% growth in overall jobs. This means that as of 2021, there are 870,268 people who are employed in the technology workforce. Current projections suggest that there will be 1 million technology workers in Australia by 2024 and 1.2 million by 2027. While the technology industry is growing overall in Australia, some occupations are growing more rapidly than others. Taking into consideration what skills are in high demand is beneficial to those who are looking to go into the industry. These skills are applied to IT specific related skills as well as general skills. This analysis of industry data will outline what the current technology industry looks like in Australia as well as what is currently projected for the future of the industry. </p>"+
"<p>The job titles for this group are: </p>"+
"<ul>"+
"<li>Ben: Data Engineer</li>"+
"<li>John: Chief Digital Officer </li>"+

"<h2>Groups Required Skill Set </h2>" + 
"<h3>IT Specific Skills </h3>" + 
"<p>Listed below are some of the IT Specific related skills required for the group’s jobs. These skills were listed by the group members during the ideal job section of Assignment One. The data used for the analysis is from Burning Glass (2018) and it is based on how in demand these skills are. Demand is based on the frequency of these skills appearing in job postings from Dec 24 2017 - Mar 23 2018.</p>"+
"<p>SQL, JavaScript, Windows, UNIX, Linux, Java, C#, .Net, Python, R, SAS, Project Management, and Business Analysis. </p>"+
"<div><img src='./itskills.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>[ This chart ranks the three highest in demand IT Specific related skills ]</p>"+
"<p><b>Findings</b>: The three highest in demand IT Specific skills are: SQL, JavaScript and JAVA. All of these skills appeared in job ads over 2800 times. These skills are all “programming” related, which aligns with the previous section ranking Software and Applications Programmers as the most in demand occupation.</p>"+
"<h3>General Skills </h3>" + 
"<p>Listed below are some of the General skills required for the group’s jobs. These skills were listed in the ideal jobs section of the group member’s previous assignment. The data is from Burning Glass (2018) and it is based on how in demand these skills are. Demand is based on the frequency of these skills appearing in postings from Dec 24 2017 - Mar 23 2018. </p>"+
"<p>Communication Skills, Problem Solving, Organisation Skills, Business Management, Leadership, Building Relationships, Planning, Troubleshooting, Analytical Skills, Meeting Deadlines</p>"+
"<div><img src='./generalskills.JPG'></div>"+
"<p>[ This chart ranks the three highest in demand General skills ]</p>"+
"<p><b>Findings</b>: The three highest in demand General skills are: Communication Skills, Problem Solving and Organisational Skills. Communication skills are the highest in demand, appearing 27,922 times more than the second highest in demand. These skills may apply to all the listed occupations, so it would be beneficial for all members to work on these skills.  </p>"+
"<p><b>Conclusion</b>: Concerning demand, the skills listed in the group’s previous assignments are seen through the general skills section more than the IT Specific skills section. The most in demand IT Specific skills are related to programming-oriented occupations, similar to the findings in the job rankings section. It should be noted, however, that only showing the ranking of the “top three” skills does not fully grasp the entirety of skills that are in demand or becoming increasingly sought after.</p>"+

"<hr>"+

"<h2>Has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h2>" + 
"<p>Ben: My opinion of my ideal job has not necessarily changed but this data analysis has made me more aware of the growth in the area of data science and the management of data. The skills that I imagined would be most in demand across the IT industry (based on the Kangaroo’s ideal job selection) were in line with my expectations. Having these data summarised has had the great benefit of highlighting the key focus areas of what skills (both hard and soft skills) are most in demand with employers. As a result, I will be tailoring my self-directed learning to focus more on the SQL and database knowledge, and I will make a concerted effort to improve both my written and verbal communication skills in preparation for entering the IT workforce. </p>"+
"<p>John: My career path has been built over 35+ years and i do not believe that an ideal job actually exists. Aligning what is valuable, generated from the research and what makes you happy are the driving factors i apply. The role CDO, is generally an extension of my current role but understanding market IT skill movements allows me to help my teams development and increases my career choices   </p>"+
"<p>Nicole: For the ideal job section of assignment one, I was unsure of what I would consider my ideal job. For this reason, I am remaining open minded and researching the current job outlook in Australia has been an interesting venture. I want to take time to further consider what my ideal job would be. During the remainder of my studies, I will be sure to keep in mind what areas I will benefit from and use the resources provided to make the most of my knowledge.</p>"+
"<p>Tarish: The stance towards and obtaining the necessary qualification for a security analyst role has not changed. The data suggest a significant uptick in the job growth for Database & Systems Administrators & ICT Security in the next 5 year. Furthermore, the industry currently has one of the lowest employment rates in the field of IT, making it a promising area for career development  </p>"+
"<p>Tatsuya: After reviewing the data analysis my opinion on my ideal job remains the same. However, the data analysis has given me insight on the future growth of software and applications programmers. The projected growth for software developers is promising with a job growth rate of 27% in the next five years. This is ideal for me as it's clear that my ideal job is currently in demand with the potential for future growth. </p>" +

"<p><a href='https://rmiteduau.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/Temp198/ETgYWyMcEdBNqCMixaHQHlsByqE1pD3HS52_E61S2DLK7g?e=iGOaQg'>SharePoint Interview Link</a> </p>"+

"<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>" +
"<p>The IT professional interviewed was Robert O’Brien. He works across in an IT tech role at an audio-visual company and in his spare time works on maintaining a private game server with around 4500 subscribed users. </p>"+
"<p>Within his role in the AV industry, he does a lot of backend work, maintaining networks for a variety of venues/event spaces across Melbourne, managing and programming the automation of sound, vision and lighting systems through programs such as Q-Sys. Another prominent role of his is the setup and hosting of web streams for virtual events, as well as the subsequent management of the cloud-based servers used to store and transfer event-related files and recordings. </p>"+
"<p>In his other project, the gaming servers, he is a jack-of-all-trades, doing a little bit of everything to ensure the smooth running of this “24-hour operation”. From working on game updates, responding to customer queries, and responding to cyber-security threats. Across the two jobs, there is no such thing as a “normal” day. </p>"+

"<h2>What kind of people does the IT professional interact with? </h2>" +
"<p>According to Rob he deals with a vast, diverse group of people on a daily basis. When discussing the AV industry he mentioned the obvious, the other members of the IT team and managements, there are the also the other coworkers who may be for example riggers or lighting techs, the venue staff who maintain the event spaces and their other associated contractors, the event talent (especially on the online events that he primarily oversees), and the clients may be anybody from high-end corporate events managers to wedding planners or the couple’s themselves. </p>"+
"<p>In regards to the game server, the main population (besides other team members) would be the players themselves. Most the other interactions being between himself and other IT professionals working in cyber-security and server management. This is because data collection and session hosting are handled on a private data centre (provided to cyber-security firms when needed) and the game server infrastructure is provided through Microsoft’s IaaS platform, Azure</p>"+

"<h2>How is most of the IT professional’s time spent? </h2>" +
"<p>In his AV role, Rob claims a significant portion of his time is spent trying to troubleshoot and solve co-worker’s problems over the phone. It’s something that is not really discussed much about the industry but whilst trying to keep on top of daily tasks and client requests he says he is often sapped of time by needing to help others out remotely. It can become such a burden that in a question about removing one responsibility from his roles, the over-the-phone tech support part was the thing he would gladly see go. </p>"+
"<p>Regarding the game server role, a majority of his time (when not overwhelmed by small bug fixes) is spent keeping up to date with the world of security, with a particular emphasis on the gaming industry and cheating. It is an ever-evolving threat that you can’t afford to fall victim to, especially as a small company. </p>"+

"<h2>What are the most challenging aspects of the IT professional's roles? </h2>" +
"<p>For both roles, the most challenging aspect is staying up to date with the newest technologies and threats. Work in the AV industry has its own set of challenges, adapting an installation to ensure it fits within a clients brief being chief among them. The true challenge here is not just staying within the budget but it is in trying to interpret what their vision is for the event, based off their limited technical perspective. From there, specifying the right equipment to get the job done becomes a whole lot simpler. </p>"+


"<h2>What are the skills that the IT professional thinks everyone entering the IT industry should have, where would they begin if they had to start over? </h2>" +
"<p>Rob said in his opinion, the soft skills around problem solving are what all people looking to enter the IT industry should look to pick up. Be it from programming to assessing security/data breaches, the ability to survey a problem from a broad perspective, discern where it is coming from, and take action to remedy it is invaluable. He used the example of programming where something as small as a simple syntax error in one line of code can create serious issues. </p>"+
"<p>His advice around what aspects of IT he would suggest people focus on first was simple, start with what you want to do. Follow the path that interests you the most as he believes there is little to gain from studying something you’re not invested in emotionally. Try the thing that piques your interest, from there, you will find out whether you like it and if it is worth pursuing. </p>"+

"<h2>In their opinion, what does the future look like for both the IT professional's field, and IT as a whole? </h2>" +
"<p>Rob gave a pretty broad answer to this question, saying that it is hard to see for certain where the IT industry is headed. The pace of change is so rapid and access to gigabit internet so freely available that the only thing that is certain is that hardware will continue to get more powerful and more affordable. IT is becoming ever more ubiquitous in our everyday lives, so who knows what the future may hold? </p>"+

"<h1><i class='fa-solid fa-microchip fa-xl'></i> IT Technologies</h1>" + 
"<h2>Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, Makey Makeys and other small computing devices</h2>" +
"<p>Integrated circuits, computer-based boards and peripherals were notoriously expensive and non-modular creating complex development environments and accessibility issues for the general population. The advent of modularised computer-based systems allowed reduced cost of manufacture and increased accessibility which in turn allowed increased development opportunities both in hardware and software. Raspberry Pis brought a small, modularised PC to the general public at low cost and using this methodology it allowed everyday users to develop products and applications without the complexity of commercial level development boards. It also allowed people from all over the world access to powerful low-cost computer-based technologies both for development and general use. Later, again due to the low-cost element and modularisation, it allowed educational entities the ability to teach students at any age, the fundamental elements of hardware and software development. Additional reading on the history of the Rasberry Pi is available on many web pages, however a short and concise text is 'The Epic Story of the Rasberry Pi' from https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-history/.Please refer to References section. </p>" +
"<p>Both raspberry Pi and adreno technologies, or more accurately, the manufacturers of these products have allowed the public access to development boards for product development. While this is a major step forward it also has issues because while these boards are cheap, commercial development into a consumer product would be considerably and preventatively expensive, most manufacturers would use the development board to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then scale the circuitry / hardware to make it commercially viable. This is beyond the capabilities of a hobbyist or someone in the general population and requires teams who can navigate the legal requirements of product development but also ensuring that the product meets standards across multiple countries, an example of this, would be EMC and CE marking for regulatory compliance for a particular country. While the Adrino and Rasberry Pi boards have passed these tests its important that the tests include its intended environment as part of those compliance regulations. </p>"+
"<p>The advantages however, enabled by these development boards allow people within the general population at both a professional and hobbyist level to learn and experiment with new concepts and ideas that without such technology would not be possible and would require sophisticated developers with bespoke development boards being created as they were in the past.  </p>"+
"<p>Due to the reduced costs of PC manufacture and Integrated Circuits (IC’s) in general and the modulization of communication protocols used generally (blue tooth, Wi-Fi etc) it is now possible to build hardware which can be thought of as “lego” expanding or reducing the main board to accommodate your application. This lends itself to small modular IC’s which perform complex functions as part of the hardware configuration and provides less development requirements for each modular element, this has been mirrored with programming languages that support these technologies in general. Languages such as C++, Python also work on modular or containerised scripts and programmes that others have developed which you are able to use within your application through the open-source licensing agreements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_license </p>"+
"<p>These elements combined provide the general population with the ability to develop very complex applications at virtually no cost. The future of this modularised concept allows us access to newer technologies such as IoT, machine learning and artificial intelligence which can be incorporated into complex hardware such as robots or self-driving cars as an example. This increasing to provide us with plug and play technologies both in hardware and software allows not just one individual to develop applications or concepts but the entire population, it is not uncommon for groups of likeminded individuals from around the world contributing to a common application, this brining substantial innovation benefits. The future, generally, is more focused on the understanding of combining all these technologies rather than development of the technology itself.  </p>"+
"<p>In the next 3 years the plug and play element or simplification of complex integrated circuits as part of expansion of the main adreno or Raspberry Pi board will become more prevalent, and less understanding will be required of the under lying technologies to develop your application. Currently this technology does not need you to understand the inner working of a 12C Communications protocol, but more how to wire the hardware using breadboards and then control the data with programming because if it did you would need additional hardware, oscilloscopes, and such things. The software element is becoming more important to understand than the hardware itself, and due to the complexities of programming in the past, newer programming languages or higher-level languages are becoming dominant, Python being a good example of this, which is accessibly to anyone with a PC and is being taught at schools and education facilities all over the world today. </p>"+
"<p>It is unlikely that Raspberry Pi’s or Adreno boards will be used in a commercial setting due to the cost of development, however, the effects of the masses having access to this technology and it being taught it in education facilities is interesting because many of the commercially developed products on the market both in hardware and software are using the same pattern and this can be seen in the use of python for the development of IoT sensors on the market now, additionally python is also used in the development of modelling software and AI technologies. The ability of people to interact with commercial products via API’s is becoming a significant development across multiple industries, this in turn is driving further demand for adreno / raspberry pi technologies for people to learn and develop on. Technologies which are built on non-modularised and old development boards and programming languages which people don’t’ understand anymore will become obsolete and this newer technology will replace them. This is because generally, bespoke, or highly complex technologies which require support become very expensive when compared to a modularised system. This will make it commercially unviable for those older systems. </p>"+
"<p>The affects to me personally would be negligible because I do not produce products within my career, those that do, would also not be directly affected if they are following a similar pattern of development as discussed above. It does however open newer possibilities for engineers, hobbyists and people working within the IT industry to gain in-depth understanding of the technologies that these boards offer more fundamentally though, it allows significant access to innovation and creativity due to its broad spectrum of users. The affect to business could be that the business IT needs to enable its staff access to these technologies allowing development of supporting software that the business uses. This would allow them to communicate with business level technologies and commercially produced technologies such as IoT devices, this will be done via the Application Programming Interface (API) available across nearly every product that businesses use today.</p>"+
"<p>This technology brings programming and software development to a much younger audience. It will allow many children to have interactions with programming as entertainment which is something that was not available in the past. </p>"+

"<h2>Cyber security</h2>" +
"<p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and devices from digital attacks, theft, and damage. It involves implementing measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. As our reliance on technology has grown, it has become easier for cybercriminals to access sensitive information and disrupt critical systems. Cybersecurity measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and secure protocols are used to prevent unauthorised access to networks, devices, and data, to protect against viruses, malware, and other types of threats. Cybersecurity is important because it helps to prevent data breaches, identity theft, and other types of cyber-attacks that can have serious consequences for individuals, businesses, and governments. This field is constantly evolving, so it is important to stay up to date with the latest best practices and technologies to keep systems and data secure.</p>"+
"<p>As almost everything digitalised now significant steps need to be taken to improve the security of data, PII and other sensitive information that is stored on digital hardware. There are several ways to improve cybersecurity in all industries. Implementing strong, unique passwords and regularly updating them is one effective way to protect against unauthorised access. Adding an extra layer of security through two-factor authentication also known as multifactor authentication (MFA) can also help. MFA involves the use of at least two different authentication components, such as something you know (e.g. a password), something you have (e.g. a security token or a smartphone), or something you are (e.g. a fingerprint or facial recognition). It is important to keep software and systems up to date with the latest security patches and updates to prevent vulnerabilities within your organisation from being exploited. Training employees on cybersecurity best practices and using encryption for sensitive data can also help reduce the risk of an attack. Regular security assessments and having a response plan to cybersecurity incidents can also help mitigate the damage and minimise the impact of an attack. It's important for organisations to take a proactive approach to cybersecurity, rather than waiting until an attack occurs before acting. By staying vigilant and taking steps to prevent attacks, organisations or individuals can better protect themselves and their customers from cyber threats.</p>"+
"<p>There are several technologies currently used in the cybersecurity industry to protect against cyber threats. The most used software-based technology that can be highlighted is the Anti-virus and anti-malware software that are designed to detect and remove malware, such as viruses, worms, and Trojan horses, from computers and devices. Firewalls are network security systems that control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules and are utilised by almost all corporation from big to small. Another significant tech used in the industry is the Intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) that help monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity and block or alert on any suspicious activity. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into coded text that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. Identity and access management (IAM) systems are designed to manage and protect the identities of users and devices within an organisation, including managing login credentials and controlling access to resources based on user permissions. Network segmentation the practice of dividing a computer network into smaller sub-networks, or segments, in order to limit the spread of a cyber threat. A technology I utilise daily is a Virtual private network (VPNs) this is used to create a secure, encrypted connection between a device and a network, allowing users to access the network securely over the internet. Security information and event management (SIEM) systems collect and analyse security-related data from multiple sources in order to identify and respond to potential cyber threats. This technology Is particularly useful for large cooperations with a complex network and provides a more centralised platform in order respond to security events and alerts. Finally, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning can be used to analyse large amounts of data and identify patterns that may indicate a cyber threat, allowing organisations to take proactive measures to prevent attacks. To sum it up, there are lots of different technologies out there that people and companies can use. Even though these technologies are advanced, they must keep changing and improving to keep up with new threats that are always emerging.</p>"+
"<p>In the future, we can expect to see the increasing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify and prevent cyber threats in real-time. There will also be a greater focus on securing data and applications in the cloud as the use of cloud computing grows. To protect against the potential threat of quantum computers breaking current encryption methods, there will likely be a greater focus on developing and adopting quantum-resistant technologies. Traditional authentication methods such as passwords are becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks, so we may see a greater focus on using biometric authentication methods like fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans to provide an additional layer of security. As the threat landscape continues to evolve, it is important for individuals and organisations to stay up-to-date on the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices, so there may be a greater emphasis on cybersecurity education and training to help individuals and organisations stay informed and protect against cyber threats.</p>"+
"<p>Cybersecurity impacts the average person in multiple ways. It is important for protecting personal information (PII) and financial information from being accessed or stolen by unauthorised bad actors. If an individual's personal information is accessed or stolen, it can be used for identity theft, which can have serious consequences including financial losses and damage to an individual. Cybersecurity is also important for protecting against fraudulent activities such as phishing scams, which can trick individuals into revealing personal information or installing malware on their devices. If an individual's accounts are hacked, they may lose access to these accounts and the information and resources associated with them. Cybersecurity is also important for protecting an individual's privacy, as it helps prevent unauthorised access to personal information or data. To protect ourselves from these risks, it is important for us to be aware of cybersecurity risks and take steps to protect themselves, such as using strong and unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping software and devices up to date. On a personal level I’m a big advocate on the former practices and urge all my friends and family to follow suit.</p>"+

"<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>" +
"<p>An autonomous vehicle or AV for short is an automobile that utilizes its environmental senses to operate fully independent without the use of human intervention. AV’s allow passengers to freely travel to a destination as a conventional car would but without the oversight of a driver. According to the “The Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders” (SMMT) autonomous vehicles are categorised into five distinct levels (SMMT 2020). The following levels can be seen below.  </p>" +
"<p>Level 0 - No Automation (Manual control) </p>" +
"<p>Level 1 - Driver Assistance (Single automated system) </p>" +
"<p>Level 2 - Partial Automation (Advanced driver assistance system) </p>" +
"<p>Level 3 - Conditional Automation (Environmental detection capabilities) </p>" +
"<p>Level 4 - High Automation (Full automation under specific conditions) </p>" +
"<p>Level 5 - Full Automation (Full automation in any conditions) </p>" +
"<p>While AV’s offer convenience to the driver it also provides numerous benefits to society. One of the main advantages AVs create is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which has evidently become an issue due to the explosion of automobile ownership. As of 2022 according to Our World in Data 45.1% of C02 emissions contribute to the global C02 emissions from transport (Our World Data 2020). Furthermore, AV’s have the potential to drastically improve transportation safety as well as greatly improving transportation logistics.  </p>" +
"<p>As of today, in 2023 the current AVs in use today range from levels zero to two with the majority of new manufactured cars being level 1 with features such as cruise control or basic steering control. Despite the rapid advancement in technology, car manufactures are still unable to overcome the technological hurdles to reach a fully autonomous vehicle which would range from level four to five. Companies such as Tesla have achieved to produce a level 2 AV with its two primary features being Tesla’s autopilot and full self-driving. Similar companies have also achieved autonomy level 2 such as GM’s super Cruise and Nissan’s ProPilot (Day.L 2021). However, due to the introduction of AV’s being relatively new to the consumer market companies such as Tesla have faced some backlash from the public. Tesla’s autopilot still requires the driver to be fully aware of its surroundings in an event of a hazard however, due to negligence of the driver several accidents have occurred during its use.</p>" +
"<p>An Autonomous car functions under five key individual process being computer vision, sensor fusion, localization, path planning, and control. When in operation the car will constantly scan for information and gather data to compile all the information together into one overall image using the sensor fusion. This is how AVs fundamentally operate as it’s constantly localizing the cars position to deduce the best optimal path/decision given in any particular circumstance. </p>" +
"<p>Computer vision allows the car to use multiple sensors to observe the surrounding environment with the use of cameras, radars, and LiDARs. Like humans we have relied on our eyes to compile visual information. The same concept applies for the cameras as it allows the computer to detect and identify physical elements on the roads and surrounding environments. These may include but not limited to road lines, traffic lights, car, etc. However, unlike eyes cameras are unable to measure depth which subsequently leads to the use of radars and LiDARs. Radar allows the computer vision to measure the distance of an object with the use of emitted radio waves while LiDAR uses lasers to measure the depth of each object called a cloud point (Dholakia.S 2019).  </p>" +
"<p>As mentioned above sensor fusion complies all the data obtained from the computer vision (Visual information, radar, LiDAR) to create a reliable and accurate depiction of the surrounding area. This is essential for the operation of the car as sensor fusion can monitor the surrounding environment in real time intern allowing the AV to determine its speed and surroundings to make accurate decisions in real time. The AV will perform this iteration multiple times a second for improved accuracy and reliability. In conjunction to computer vision, AVs utilizes the use of localization to provide an extremely accurate position of the car. This is achieved by compiling the data measurements (e.g. distance) and GPS coordinates to triangulate the exact position of the vehicle on a macro and micro level (Dholakia.S 2019).</p>" +
"<p>With the use of computer vision and localization, the car will then begin its path planning and decision making to determine the saftest, practical, and most convenient route from point A to B. Path planning can be broken down into two key elements being behaviour prediction of mobile objects and behaviour planning. Using the computer vision with the help of multiple model algorithms the AV can predict the behaviour of surrounding environment to determine the most likely trajectory of a manoeuvrable object. The algorithms simultaneously predict each objects trajectory to allow the car to compute the probability of each object to which it determines the best possible action. While behaviour planning balances the efficiency, safety, and comfort to reach its destination in a suitable manner (Ryabchuk.P 2018).  </p>" +
"<p>Finally, control allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake to reach its destination using the data and trajectory of the path planner. Once the path planning has determined the cars trajectory it will send instructions to the electronic control unit (ECU) for the AV to execute.  </p>" +
"<p>As mentioned above majority of new cars on the road today are level 1 with a few companies producing level 2 AVs onto the market such as Tesla. However, companies such as Honda and Mercedes have introduced level 3 AVs to the market however, only under certain conditions being the highway. While on the highway Honda’s Sensing Elite and Mercedes Drive Pilot does not require the driver to pay attention.  The future of AVs is promising as companies such as Waymo are currently undergoing development of a level 4 AV aiming to remove the need for driver hand offs. As of now Waymo have introduced a small amount of driverless robotaxi service under trial for testing (Dholakia.S 2019). Furthermore, many truck companies are pushing for fully autonomous trucks due to the shortage of truck drivers. </p>" +
"<p>At the current rate of advancement in technology we would expect many AVs to popularise our roads very soon into the near future. If AVs populated our roads the impact it will create would increase road safety, transportation logistics and provide industrial/economic benefits. However, the introduction of AV’s will impact many jobs around the world making many jobs redundant while also creating many new jobs. According to the Society of Motor Manufactures and Traders (SMMT) by 2030 the AV industry will add 51 billion a year to the UK economy as well as creating an additional 320 000 jobs (SMMT 2020). Due to AV’s increasing safety on our roads its most likely cars that are level 0 and 1 will begin to transition into modern level 2 to 4 AV’s. This will also make combustion vehicles redundant due to the extensive advantages AVs provide. Furthermore, a drastic change in infrastructure will commence as AV’s heavily relies on GPS requiring a minimum of 4G to operate. Most countries around the world do not currently have the required infrastructure needed to fully implement AVs into society.  </p>" +
"<p>Autonomous vehicles would have a drastic impact on myself due to the convenience AVs provide. It would change my routine and improve time management allowing me to become more flexible. AV’s will improve safety not only for myself but for other individuals. For example, social events that includes the consumption of alcohol would allow people to travel home safely and reliably. More importantly AV’s will allow people who are disadvantaged (elderly, disabilities, etc) to travel freely without the help of another individual allowing for disadvantaged people to be more independent. Overall, autonomous vehicles would significantly improve quality of life and convenience to myself and friends/family.  </p>" +

"<h1><i class='fa-solid fa-diagram-project fa-xl'></i> Team Project</h1>" + 
"<h2>The Courtesy Light</h2>" +

"<h4>Overview</h4>" +
"<p>This project idea is about a theoretical design called The Courtesy light. The Courtesy light is a small, simple, and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when activated by a simple press of a button mounted somewhere convenient in the driver’s seat compartment. The Courtesy light will also include customization via an app connected through Bluetooth. Throughout the following report the project will discuss in detail about the individual aspects of the design, features, and software. In addition, the report will evaluate the feasibility and required skills to allow this project to be a reality. Furthermore, the report will outline the impacts that the Courtesy light would create if it were to be introduced to the public.   </p>" +

"<h4>Motivation</h4>" +
"<p>A road rage survey was conducted by Budget Direct in 2021 with results showing that 45% of Australians have admitted to showing signs of road rage with 75% of Australians being a victim of road rage (Budget Direct 2021). Whether we like it or not almost every vehicle owner has at least once been the subject of road rage, however, occasionally someone will show some courtesy on the road. Whether that be letting someone in or giving way or you may have left something on top of the car. Regardless of the situation we all get a sense of appreciation and think to ourselves I wish I could at least say ‘’Thanks/Sorry” to brighten up the fellow commuter’s day. In our current modern-day society, the use of cars has drastically expanded our capacity to travel. This is evident as according to (Kemp 2022), there are currently 1.446 billion cars on the road as of 2022.  Therefore, this provides a vast extensive market for the use of a small, simple, and sleek LED that displays “Thanks” or “Sorry” when activated by a simple press of a button mounted somewhere convenient in the driver’s seat compartment.   </p>" +

"<h4>Description</h4>" +
"<p>The product LED “Thanks/Sorry” display can be called Courtesy light for short. The Courtesy light’s two main features is an LED display that will either display Sorry or Thanks. This will be activated using two simple buttons, one button will display Sorry and the other Thanks. Furthermore, an app will be available for personal customization and controllability. The fundamental design of the Courtesy light is to keep it as simple as possible as it is important not to overwhelm the driver with many features and buttons as this would lead to a safety hazard as it may be more of a distraction than a tool.   </p>" +
"<p>Even though there are 1.446 billion cars, not all these cars will be the same as there are numerous different cars manufactures with their own unique design. It is important that The Courtesy light has a universal installation method to allow the use of an LED light to operate in any vehicle. If the Courtesy light were only compatible with one specific car model this would drastically reduce the consumer market. A cheap and simple solution for this is the use of Velcro. The buttons will be mounted with the use of Velcro for easy and simple setup with the intention of user friendliness. The use of Velcro will allow the user to choose where the buttons will be set up for convince. Furthermore, as each car is different the use of the Velcro will allow universal compatibility with any car thus, anyone can use the product. Like the buttons the LED display will also use Velcro for the installation.   </p>" +
"<p>The colour of the LED will be green. The colour green has been chosen as green generally represents a positive colour which will help further convey the message to the other drivers. In addition, green was chosen as it will not interfere with the existing lights on the vehicle. If the display were to be orange or red, it may be mistaken for a turn signal or break lights which would intern lead to a safety hazard to other drivers.  When the display is activated, the display will be a static light. If the display were to have flashing lights or cool animations, it would present more of a distraction rather than a message. For this reason, once the button is pressed the message will only display for a short period of time to allow the other driver to recognize the message without impeding the driver's focus. To further ensure safety the LED’s will be set to a minimum legible brightness to prevent excessive light pollution.  </p>" +
"<p>The Courtesy light will also include personal customization by an app which can be downloaded via any Appstore. The app will allow the user to pair with the Courtesy light using Bluetooth. The app will feature language options as well as animations to create variability and improve the aesthetic appeal of the product. The customizable animations allow the user to pick which direction the text will display (e.g top to down, left to right, etc) to best fit the users’ preferences. The language options will allow for different languages to display which intern expands the consumer market and availability across the globe. With the addition of the downloadable app, it allows for the product to be user-friendly while also offering ease of access which intern enhances the user experience. </p>" +
"<p>However, one major drawback of the Courtesy light is that the language options will only include common languages. While common languages will be available there are still many opportunities to expand the language options. A solution to this would be to provide updates for the app to incorporate other languages into the display.   </p>" +

"<h4>Tools and Technologies</h4>" +
"<p>The aim of the Courtesy light was to keep the design as simple as possible, for this will allow for easy and cheap manufacturing. The image shown below is a basic circuit diagram of the Courtesy light. </p>" +
"<img src='./CircuitDiagram.png' alt='CircuitDiagram' id='img_fullsize'></img>"+
"<p>This circuit demonstrates how the Courtesy light will operate and how the individual components and hardware are connected. The hardware needed for the RGB light is a Arduino Uno – R3, generic breadboard, 12V battery holder, LED matrix, resistors, push button, capacitor, voltage regulator, Bluetooth serial module and jumper wires. The software required can be any software language. An example of such software can be python, atom.io or C+ just to name a few. All the components listed can be seen in the labelled circuit diagram. With all these components a basic version of the Courtesy light can be created.</p>" +

"<h4>Skills Required</h4>" +
"<p>The hardware skills required for the required project would be to at least have a basic knowledge of electrical circuits. The project will be using an Arduino Uno, which requires basic knowledge of hardware to understand how they operate and function.  To obtain these skills you can either research and learn from an open source such as the internet or take the relevant course through an education institute. The software aspect would be to have general knowledge of any programing language. The project requires code to be able to program what lights display and to program the buttons to activate for only a short period of time. These skills can be obtained through research from an open source or to study through an education institute such as a university.   </p>" +

"<h4>Outcome</h4>" +
"<p>If this project were successful many cars around the world would have installed The Courtesy light into their cars. Furthermore, if the project were successful many drivers around the world would have theoretically diffused many road rage situations. An example might be that driver one has accidentally cut off someone making the other driver two frustrated and on edge. However, if driver one displays the “Sorry” LED, driver two will regionalize that it was an accident. By just showing a little courtesy on the roads every day around the world it would lead to a much healthier environment on the public roads thus leading to less road rage and unnecessary toxicity. In Conclusion if the Courtesy light was introduced into the market, it would impact the number of road rage incidents occurring on public roads.   </p>" +

"<hr>"+

"<h2>John Gude</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>As a group of people with varying backgrounds who had never met before, we came together and collaborated very well to complete the assignment within the scheduled deadlines. Our organisation and time management were our strengths.</p>"+
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>Decision making on what the project would be could have been improved and decisions made earlier in the process. However, the feasibility of the project was an early concern to the group and made deciding on the project more complex. The group used a voting system to get the consensus based on 3 concept ideas. It was decided through that medium that simplicity would be advantageous to us in the later stages should the concept idea need building.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>That the team didn’t require direct leadership. We all contributed effectively and were proactive on taking action to complete tasks that need doing rather than having someone assign tasks to them. This team was built on initiative and collective benefit which is unusual within a new group of people.</p>"+
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>People often play down or are not confident about their skills or what they can offer in group situations.</p>"+
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>The team used MS Teams as their primary communication platform. Weekly meetings were set up  along with meeting agenda and minutes, however MS teams chats was used as required during the week for general conversations and updates. Git updates messages were reflective of the updates by the team and were easy to understand and track. However, due to the configuration of the webpage, most updates were text based for the assignment sections rather than coding level updates. Access to Git and GitHub and teams was provided to all members while recordings etc were located on SharePoint, MS Teams repository. Alignment of GitHub updates and tasks allocated to team members during meetings mirrored very closely</p>" +

"<h2>Benjamin Turner</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the kangaroos team early on decided to divide up the tasks between members based on our skillsets and interest areas. This proved to be a good decision as it minimised friction between team members in terms of our contributions and ensured we all had a set of tasks to perform.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>I think initially we were a bit reserved in terms of communication in Microsoft Teams and the meetings, but this got better once we began to get to know each other. We were also a bit hesitant in making group decisions regarding the project topic.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>I was honestly surprised at how open everyone was to help if other team members were having issues. I have worked in teams before where there was an expectation that we all made our contributions, but it was the burden of one or two to pick up the slack (nominated as editors or scribes for example), but here things have been very smooth with everyone working to their strengths.</p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>I have learnt the value of open discussion regarding updating team other team members on progress of our sections. It ensures all team members are on the same page or can make adjustments to the workload if need be. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p>I feel the GitHub activity log does not necessarily accurate trace of amount of work done by team members overall but it does show that we were all participating. Whether individuals decided to add their contributions in large batches, in a series of small commits, or had others upload their sections, the logs can make it seem like some team members did significantly more work than the others which is not the case.</p>" +
"<p>That said the group meeting discussion and meeting minutes documents are a closer reflection to how the work was divided amongst team members. We were quite active in the message forums within Microsoft Teams as well as regularly uploading our work into a shared template document and later a shared document for submission.</p>" +

"<h2>Tarish Kapur</h2>" +
"<h4>What went well?</h4>" +
"<p> The team was able to come together effectively and establish clear goals and objectives for the assignment. Through effective communication among team members, they were able to understand the tasks assigned to them after the first meeting.</p>" +
"<h4>What could be improved?</h4>" +
"<p>The team performed exceptionally well and there were no major issues to be addressed. However, one suggestion for improvement would be in the decision-making process when selecting the group project. Initially, there was some uncertainty among the team, but they ultimately decided to use a voting poll to make the final decision. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that was surprising?</h4>" +
"<p>The team's organisation was a surprise to me. From the setup of GitHub pages to the structured meeting agendas, and the proactive attitude of each team member in completing assigned tasks. Additionally, the team's technical knowledge, particularly in coding and setting up GitHub pages was instrumental in the successful setup of the website. </p>" +
"<h4>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h4>" +
"<p>Clear communication and organisation are vital components for the success of any group. They can determine the effectiveness of the group's performance. </p>" +
"<h4>Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your group’s work on the assignment</h4>" +
"<p> The team found the GitHub log to be user-friendly, and several members were proficient in its use. This made it easy to resolve any issues that arose during the assignment. </p>" +
